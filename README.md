Deep Learning applied to Bitcoin 



![Deep Learning](Images/deep-learning.jpg)

Enclosed please find two Jupyter Lab notebooks, each modeling the bitcoin closing prices in regard to the [Crypto Fear and Greed Index (FNG)](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/). 

This modeling was done in two different ways: one model applies FNG indicators, while the other model is restricted to closing price data alone. Both models use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN's). 

Also added a time tracking feature to start being aware of length of time various functions run.

# Acknowledgements

I would like to first acknowledge the guidance and teaching of our FinTech Boot Camp Instructor, Garth Mortensen, our Student Success Manager, Angelica Baraona; and the whole team behind the curriculum, the logistics, the whole program. I also found the collective Stack Overflow wisdom essential as ever. My other available resource was 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow' by Aurelien Geron. Happy to be more aware of these functionalities going forward, and will continue to pay attention as the field continues to advance!
