Deep Learning applied to Bitcoin 



![Deep Learning](Images/deep-learning.jpg)

Enclosed please find two Jupyter Lab notebooks, each modeling the bitcoin closing prices in regard to the [Crypto Fear and Greed Index (FNG)](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/). 

This modeling was done in two different ways: one model applies FNG indicators, while the other model is restricted to closing price data alone. Both models use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN's).

# Acknowledgements

I would like to first acknowledge the guidance and teaching of our FinTech Boot Camp Instructor, Garth Mortensen, our Student Success Manager, Angelica Baraona; and the whole team behind the curriculum, the logistics, the whole program. I also found the collective Stack Overflow wisdom essential as ever.
